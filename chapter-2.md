This draft based on the lecture at [here](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/book/chapters/objects.html).

I will drop the quotation notation, which makes this note not that clear. In fact, most of this content is quotated from the lecture.

## Data Abstraction

### Review of Functional Abstraction

Functional Astraction is *abstraction of pattern (of definitions of functions)*, which, with its motivation, is summaried in the note on chapter 1 (the final section), re-written as follow.

> The important thing is that *do not to write the same thing twice!* These words directly lead to _abstraction (of pattern)_ in programming. To illustrate this, a concise (too concise to be re-stated) instance is shown in the [lecture](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/book/chapters/functions.html#functions-as-arguments)!!
> 
> First-class status setting of Python provides vast tools for establishing this abstraction (of pattern)!

### Analogy to Data Abstraction

Data abstraction takes the same idea as that of functional abstraction.
